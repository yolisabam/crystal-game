# The Solar System Game
The Solar System Game generates a random number bewteen 19-120 and displays it at the top of the screen. Each planet is assigned a random value between 1-12. User clicks each button in and attempt to make their result (displayed at the bottom of the page) and the random number match. If the user matches these numbers their wins go up by 1, the game resets and generates new values to planets and random number. If the user result is greater than the random number, user loses and game resets. Wins and lossed are tallied until the page is refreshed.
